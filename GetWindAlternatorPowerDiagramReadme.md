Obtain the power curve of a wind turbine by introducing points of the power graph
-V0: Get dataset, for example Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset
-V1: plot figure with power production and Theorical production
-V2: define and show upper and lower limits for power
-V2.2: for regression i use ExtraTreesRegressor
-V2.3: Create file .sav, load .sav file and predict value(kW) for wind speed introduced by operator
